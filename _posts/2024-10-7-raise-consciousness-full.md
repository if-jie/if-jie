title: "Raise consciousness"

%%This document can be read, organized, and written by thinking about it like a tree, where the main idea is presented first (trunk), it is expanded upon/explained through other sentences (branches), which make it easy to come up with actionable ideas (leaves)%%

Goal

To accelerate humanity’s use of electrical technologies to increase their consciousness
    Why
        - Because people already want this, but they have been going about it in an indirect manner
			- Why do we need help when trying to increase consciousness? Because there's too much information and not enough guidance. 
				- There is an internal guidance which we can tap into
				- There is also external guidance which 
					- we may not have been connected to before, or 
					- we may not see how it is beneficial to connect with it just yet (we may be using the intellect and logic too much to determine what to do next), or 
					- the external guidance hasn't adapted itself to us (via technological barriers, language, skill gap, lack of resources), or 
					- we may be too busy, or 
					- we may be too focused on aspects of life which we don't need to (and that we have already solved)
		- Because people already use technologies/tools in order to increase their consciousness (in the form of rituals, practices, substances, sounds, places, spaces, stories, breathing, mindset, etc.), but maybe electrical technologies have not been used as much as they could  
		- Because electrical technologies are extremely widespread in humanity, and tools within them can be spread very rapidly and influentially
		- Because I could not find similar work being done in this area, or the work being done is not prominent enough for what society needs, or it is guided by sources which are not aiming to raise their consciousness concurrently with their effort in this area, or the work is not encompassing enough
	What
	    - Electrical technologies
		    Are all the technologies that use electricity in order to function.
			    - Analog technologies are those that use the various properties of electricity (like voltage, current, resistance, capacitance, inductance and the electromagnetic field) in order to encode information to provide a desired result. They make transmission easy but it is harder to reliably output the exact same information. For example, in a speaker, a signal’s voltage represents the pitch of a sound to be performed at a given instant. This allows the information to be transmitted from where it is stored to the speaker via a cable so the sound is output as desired. If something changes the voltage in the cable, like some movement or some other device operating nearby, the sound output will be different than what was intended. 
			      Common analog technologies include photocopiers, land-line telephones, audio tapes, old CRT televisions (intensity and color information per scan line), and VCRs
			    - Digital technologies are those that use only two possible states of an electrical signal in order to encode information. This makes it easier to output the exact information needed, but storing is a bit harder because now every single data requires more digits in order to be stored. For example, if you want to represent the number 21 (twenty-one) in a numbering system that uses 10 values per digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), you only need 2 places (21), but if you use one that only has 2 values per digit (0 or 1), now you need at least 5 places (10101).
			      Common digital technologies include most technology controlled by a computer, like: Video Games, Website, Online Buying and Selling, Smartphones, Blockchain Technology, Cryptocurrency, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing, 5G Data, Voice Interfaces or Chat-bots, Video Streaming, eBooks, Digital Music, Geo-location, Blogs, Social Media, Gadgets, 3D Printing, Self-Scan Equipment, ATM Machines, Digital Cameras, Cars and Other Vehicles, Digital Clocks, Robotics, Drones and Missiles, Banking and Finances, Smart Household Appliances 
			Like with any other technology, we don’t say that one is good and the other is bad. We understand them properly and use each where they are best suited. 
		- Consciousness
			Language is probably not a tool fit to describe it properly. The cultures and people that have observed it more carefully describe the whole universe as consciousness. Some people simplify it as saying that it is the capacity of noticing one’s existence.
		- Expand consciousness
			Language is probably not a tool fit to describe it properly. The closest I can describe it with words is by saying that the level of consciousness in a person is the intensity with which it is aware of itself, and everything it is experiencing.
			Consciousness can be expanded though the body, mind, emotions, or energy.
				For example, in terms of the body, an increase in consciousness can be seen as the difference between doing a given physical action with a certain muscle contracted while not being aware of it, and doing the same action with the same muscle relaxed because one was aware of it and therefore was able to relax it.
				It is less important to focus on what the goal looks like than it is to focus on what are the compulsions you want to be freed from, and work on them.
	When
		ASAP
	Where
		Anywhere in the universe where electricity can be manipulated
	Who
		Every human being who is or could be influenced by electrical technologies %%Initially. This scope could be widened in the future e.g. to animals, other sentient beings%%
