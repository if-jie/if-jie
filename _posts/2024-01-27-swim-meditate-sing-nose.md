I went swimming in the morning. It is only 1 station away, but I took the train (subway). The small pool was today very shallow (only 75 cm deep), due to children's swimming lessons. I swam there a bit, but I felt a bit dizzy due to shallowness. I moved to a bigger pool. Someone was swimming backstroke really slowly in my free-style lane, so I moved to another lane, and I also did backstroke there. When I swim backstroke, my heart pumps very hard. I also feel water pressure against my instep (top of the foot). I love swimming, because it cleans my body. Afterwards, my body also feels very warm from hard work and warm shower. Swimming is my favorite part of European life. 

Today I meditated with Helsana App for 10 minutes. 

Went to practice singing in a small group. This time only 2 women. 1 Alto and 1 Soprano. Since I missed the last exercise (I forgot the appointment!) I made an extra effort not to miss it. The bus came late, and I was a little late, but luckily we practiced in a relaxed and happy mood. We sang songs from rise-up. Thanks to Udo, I knew many of them. I felt happy, that I am being better integrated in the life here, and becoming more like locals. It is important for me to meet people in person and do something together. I like that we work together for the common goal. 

After the singing, as we left the building, there were many children on the ground floor. They were playing pranks on everyone. They decorated everyone's nose upon exiting the building. A bit like Rudolf reeindeer. I laughted so much many times afterwards. Such a cute gesture. Often I don't know how to best interact with teenangers or children. It is nice when they approach, at their own pace. (A bit like when a cat approaches a human, I wait.) I didn't wash my nose for many hours, until I went to bed.
